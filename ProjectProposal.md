# SHALL YOU PASS JAVA?

**Team Members:** Rachel Lo, Jordan Lee, Christian Dell'Edera<br>
**Category:** Educational/Entertainment

## 1. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Students spend too much time dreading studying because learning Java, especially for the first time, can be extremely overwhelming. Besides class material, existing study and education tools for learning programming are boring, repetitive, and not appealing at all. Java teachers may also struggle to keep their class engaged due to lengthy, wordy conceptual content that is required to start coding.

## 2. SOLUTION

With our souls-like/rogue-like quiz game, students can learn Java in an engaging and challenging way, while teachers have an educational tool they can use in class. The content of our game provides an introductory method of instilling core Java values for beginners. With an unforgiving, yet interesting format, we can boost memorization and fun for anyone who wants to learn Java fundamentals.

**MVP:** 'Shall You Pass Java?' Game Demo
**Core Features:** Interactive souls-like/rogue-like gameplay, basic level and question system, difficulty options, story branching

## 3. TARGET MARKET

Our target market includes programming students, teachers, and anyone interested in learning Java. According to EducationDataInitiative.org, there were "19.28 million undergraduate students nationwide in Fall 2024" and 3.46% of those students are enrolled in computer science and technology (Hanson, 2025, p.1).

## 4. WHY IT'S VALUABLE
